# Python_Basics
I started to self-study Python in 2019, mainly with the app called "SoloLearn". As I went on, I tried to take notes. These are my notes. I covered as many topics as I could.
- 2020 edit: I also added some new files as I learned more from the coursera google IT specialization course.
- 2023 edit: I uploaded new files and modified old files to better clarify the concepts and eradicate complicated comments.
