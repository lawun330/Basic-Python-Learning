# Basics Python Learning
I started to self-study Python in 2019, mainly with the app called "**SoloLearn**". As I went on, I tried to take notes. I covered as many topics as I could.
This repository is a reflection of my learning journey.

## Naming Convention
- If the name of a file begins with `Documentation`, the file is an *executable* script that documents all possible features for that particular topic. 
- If the name of a file begins with `Notes`, the file is a script which is *not intended to be executed*. It also documents necessary insights and information for that particular topic. The reason of that file being in `.py` format, and not in `.txt`, is that Python IDEs display colors for Python codes, but not for plain text files.
- If the name of a file contains underscore(s) _ , the file is written after I have gained basic Python knowledge.
- If the name of a file uses spaces instead of underscores, the file is written before I have gained basic Python knowledge.

## Changes With Edits
- 2020 edit: I added some new files as I learned Python from the "**Google IT Automation with Python**" specialization on Coursera.
- 2023 edit: I uploaded new files and modified old files to clarify the concepts better and delete unncessary comments.
- 2024 edit: With my knowledge gained through experience, I rewrite scripts, rename files, and organize them by moving to corresponding directories. The process makes the repository more beginner friendly.
