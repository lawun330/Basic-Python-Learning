# PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)
# PEP 8 guide 

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit. (Spell out what your code is doing)
# Simple is better than complex. (Try to be simple)
# Complex is better than complicated. (IF not, try not to be complicated)
# Flat is better than nested. (Heavily nested structures should be avoided eg. list of list of list)
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. (Do not break rules)
# Although practicality beats purity. (Be practical)
# Errors should never pass silently. (At least try to output error message)
# Unless explicitly silenced. #(sematic error > assert handling, runtime error > handle it)
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. (Not more than one way to do it)
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

################################

# modules must have short lowercase name # eg. 
import re

# class name should be this style # eg. 
class TheClassName

# function and variable should be lowercase with underscores # eg. 
def function_name():
	variable_of_this = ''
	pass

# constants are uppercase with underscores # eg. 
SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 3 * (10 ** 8)

# if name(word) clashes with python keywords that word will have trailing underscore or lighten with pink # eg. 
class class

# each code line should not have more than 80 words 

# importing modules without names should be avoided # eg. 
from math import pi

# one statement per line is allowed

# use space rather than tab and indent (the space and tab that is used at the beginning)
## maximum is 4 spaces per line
